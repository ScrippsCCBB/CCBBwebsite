# 2022 - CCBB Services: Transcriptomics

**- RNA-Seq, UMI-based RNA-Seq, High Throughput RNA-Seq (“Drug-Seq”),
smallRNA-Seq (miRNA-Seq)**

**- Single cell RNA-Seq, immune profiling - V(D)J, Visium Spatial
transcriptomics (10x Genomics)**

**RNA-Seq (standard Level 1 services: ~3 to 5 business days)**

**Requirements:**
<ol>

-   Read targets reached (e.g. ~ 20 million reads per sample; human
    genome) for each of your samples in the study

-   Number of samples submitted are less than 20

-   Sample metadata (sample conditions and comparisons to be done)
    shared with CCBB prior to sequencing

-   3 or more biological replicates per condition in your experiment

-   Reference genomes considered as standard: human, mouse, rat

</ol>

**Level 1 services:** CCBB effort level - 2 hours

**Standard analysis using nf-core/rnaseq workflow:** Alignment to
reference genome using STAR, raw gene counts (FeatureCounts),
differential gene expression analyses (DESeq2, R) along with PCA plot,
MultiQC summary file with several QC plots/tables.

**Level 2 services:** CCBB effort level - 5 hours

-   Outlier removal and re-analysis

-   Multiple sets of standard analysis

-   Analysis involving non-standard genomes

-   Custom differential gene expression

-   Differential gene expression analysis on publicly available datasets

-   Comparisons/inclusion of older datasets for re-analysis

-   Advaita functional analysis

-   GSEA or SetRank analysis
