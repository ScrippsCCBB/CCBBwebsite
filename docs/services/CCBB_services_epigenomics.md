# CCBB services Epigenomics: 

* ChIP-Seq/eCLIP-Seq/CUT&RUN/CUT&TAG/RIP-Seq

* ATAC-Seq 

## ChIP-Seq/eCLIP-Seq/CUT&RUN/CUT&TAG/RIP-Seq  

Requirements:

1 Read targets reached (e.g. ~ 10 million reads per sample; human genome for each of your samples in the study)

2 Number of sample submitted are less than 10

3 Sample metadata (description of ChIP and INPUT samples shared with CCBB prior to sequencing)

4 Biological replicates if any for your ChIP samples

5 Reference genomes considered as standard: human, mouse, rat

### Standard analysis (CCBB effort level - 5 hours; 3-5 business days)

* Alignment to reference genome using BWA

* peak calling (using protocol specific peak callers)

* BigWig files

* HOMER to annotate peaks relative to gene features along with QC plots/tables. 

### Additional analysis (consult CCBB for effort level and timeline for completion)

* Integration analysis (e.g. ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq)

* Contribution to writing a scientific paper including Methods section 

* Motif discovery

* Help with visualization etc.



## ATAC-Seq 

### Standard analysis (CCBB effort level - 5 hours; 3-5 business days)

* Alignment to reference genome using BWA

* MACS2 for peak-calling

* bed and BigWig files

* HOMER to annotate peaks relative to gene features.

### Additional analysis (consult CCBB for effort level and timeline for completion)

* Motif searching

* ATAC_ChIP and RNA-Seq 

* TF Footprinting

* DE analysis
