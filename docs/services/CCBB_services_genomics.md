# CCBB services - Genomics

* Exome

* Whole Genome sequencing data analyses

* SNPs

* indels

* CNVs
	
## Whole Genome sequencing  

Requirements:

1 Each sample in your project should have recommended read depth.

2 Number of sample submitted are less than 20

3 Sample metadata (sample descriptions) shared with CCBB prior to sequencing

4 Tumor / normal pairs (if any)

5 Reference genomes considered as standard: human, mouse, rat

### Standard analysis (CCBB effort level - 2 to 4 hours; 3-5 business days)

* Alignment to standard reference genome (human/mouse/rat)

### Additional analysis (consult CCBB for effort level and timeline for completion)

* Help with visualization of alignments

* Custom analysis based on alignment data (.bam) files


## SNPs/indels/CNVs  (CCBB effort level - 5 hours; 3-5 business days)

### Standard analysis

* nf-core/sarek workflow to detect variants on whole genome or targeted sequencing data: 

* Data processing uses GATK4 best practices for alignment to reference genome using BWA

* Mark Duplicates

* Base (Quality Score) Recalibration steps. 

* Variant Calling (germline/somatic variants specific software), Annotation and QC plots/tables provided.

## Additional analysis (consult CCBB for effort level and timeline for completion)


Additional services: Consult CCBB to get a quote/estimation of effort in hours. CCBB service hourly charges apply.

* Software development, custom pipeline implementation

* Re-analysis of older dataset

* Analysis for public dataset

* Specific figures/tables for publications; writing methods section or contribution for scientific papers/grant proposals

* Functional Analysis using Advaita/GSEA/SetRank

* Letter of Support for grants

* GEO/SRA submissions
