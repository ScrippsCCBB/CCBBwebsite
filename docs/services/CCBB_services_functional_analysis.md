## Functional Analysis

* We offer functional analysis using Advaita's iPathwayGuide as well as GSEA.


## Advaita iPathwayGuide

*Requirements*:

1. Read targets reached (e.g. ~ 20 million reads per sample; human genome) for each of your samples in the study

2. Number of sample submitted are less than 20

3. Sample metadata (sample conditions and comparisons to be done) shared with CCBB prior to sequencing

4. 3 or more biological replicates per condition in your experiment

5. Reference genomes considered as standard: human, mouse, rat

## GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis)
