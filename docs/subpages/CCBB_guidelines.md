### CCBB Authorship/Acknowledgement Guidelines
Please consider these guidelines for including CCBB personnel who worked on your projects as co-authors in your publications.  
- Payment of expenses for CCBB services rendered and authorship are not mutually exclusive. 
- Depending on their contribution, CCBB personnel should be considered collaborators just as the academic colleagues who contribute intellectually and receive funding to work on a project. 
- The recovery of our expenses through the recharge system does not exclude the possibility for authorship for our personnel. 
- Similarly, authorship does not substitute for payment of expenses for CCBB services rendered. 
- CCBB personnel who have contributed to the project, but whose contributions do not rise to the level justifying authorship, can be recognized in an Acknowledgements section of the manuscript as follows:  
“The authors acknowledge the support of the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB) at Scripps Research”.

### CCBB Data Guidelines
- Internal (Scripps) customers: CCBB takes the responsibility to archive the sequencing data, but recommends customers to maintain their own backup of the data dispatched.
- External (Non-Scripps) customers: CCBB’s responsibility for the sequencing data ends once the data is dispatched and verified for its integrity by the customers.
Please contact ccbb.at.scripps.edu for your questions.
