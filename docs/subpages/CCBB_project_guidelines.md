Have a sequencing project? Follow the steps below for an effective and efficient outcome for your requests:

## STEP 1: 

Email Steve Head, Genomics Core Director, at shead.at.scripps.edu to discuss your proposed project and include  ccbb.at.scripps.edu if you are interested in Raw data / fastqs / data analyses. This step is critical to identify and allocate the right set of resources for good time/cost estimates.

Share the biological context of your sequencing project (simple text or “Fig.1”).

## STEP 2: 

Submit a request for access to Genomics Core facility at Idea Elan database, Infinity, [secure21.ideaelan.com](https://secure21.ideaelan.com/secure/public/applogin.aspx) if this is your first sequencing project.

## STEP 3: 

If you already have access to the Genomics Core facility, please login and submit the Sample Submission form available under the “Request Services” tab. 

Need help? Email Sheila Roberts Weiland at shkay.at.scripps.edu

## STEP 4:

Samples can be submitted to the Genomics Core facility during office hours on weekdays. Coordinate with John [jshimo.at.scripps.edu] and Jessica [jledesma.at.scripps.edu] to leave your samples in the freezer near the front door of the facility:

Building Name: Skaggs Institute For Chemical Biology, Campus Map
(<a href="https://www.scripps.edu/_files/pdfs/footer/contact/scripps-california-campus-map.pdf">Scripps
California Campus Map</a>) MB-28, 10596 N. Torrey Pines Rd., La Jolla CA
92037.

## STEP 5:

If you plan on receiving raw data on a hard drive, deposit an external hard drive with enough space at the Genomics Core facility at the time of sample submission.

## STEP 6: 

(Non-Scripps) External customers requesting fastqs and/or results of analysis (any processed data) must create an AWS S3 bucket with specifications provided [AWS Instructions](aws_data_dispatch.md) and share the requested details with ccbb.at.scripps.edu at the time of sample submission.

## STEP 7: 

Consult our services page and click the relevant service type to get a quick glance at the timelines/costs involved (in terms of the number of hours for CCBB effort) for completing your requests. 

## STEP 8: 

Follow the *Recommended Guidelines for Authorship on Manuscripts*

## STEP 9: 

Please give us your feedback to better serve your sequencing needs!

STEPS 2 and 3 apply to internal (Scripps) customers only.
