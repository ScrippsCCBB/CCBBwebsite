| [Transcriptomics](../services/CCBB_services_transcriptomics.md)       | RNA-Seq, UMI-based RNA-Seq, High Throughput RNA-Seq (”Drug-Seq”), smallRNA-Seq (miRNA-Seq) |
| Single-cell analytics | Gene expression, Immune profiling (VDJ, VDJ+Gene expression), Epigenome profiling (ATAC, Multiome ATAC + Gene expression) |
| Spatial genomics      | SNP-based demultiplexing of multiplexed data <br> Visium Spatial transcriptomics (10x Genomics) |
| [Genomics](../services/CCBB_services_genomics.md)  | GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (nanoString) <br> Exome, Whole Genome sequencing data analyses, SNPs, indels, CNVs  |
| [Epigenomics](../services/CCBB_services_epigenomics.md)           | ChIP-Seq/eCLIP-Seq/CUT&RUN/RIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq   |

| Custom analyses       | Sequencing data analyses for specific lab projects that use standard tools, software packages and/or custom code/script developed by CCBB. |
| Public Datasets       | Analyses on public dataset available at NCBI’s GEO database repository |
| Functional Analyses   | Advaita’s iPathwayGuide for a full comprehensive functional analysis including pathways/GO terms/mRNAs/upstream regulators/diseases ADVAITA service request <br> Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) |
| Consultations         | We provide consultations on experimental design, overview of analyses and costs involved. We can take on both short-term (typically less than a month and about 10 hours of CCBB effort) and long-term collaborative projects involving bioinformatic support. |
| GEO/SRA uploads       | We can submit your sequencing data, related sample metadata and the results of analyses to NCBI repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for a small service fee. |
|  Flow Cytometry Analysis |  Custom Flow Cytometry Analysis Pipeline for QC, Visualization, and dimension reduction analysis |
