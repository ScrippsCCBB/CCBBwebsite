# CCBB services

## Transcriptomics

* RNA-Seq, UMI-based RNA-Seq, High Throughput RNA-Seq (”Drug-Seq”), smallRNA-Seq (miRNA-Seq)

* Single cell RNA-Seq, immune profiling - V(D)J, Visium Spatial transcriptomics (10x Genomics)

## RNA-Seq

*Requirements*:

1. Read targets reached (e.g. ~ 20 million reads per sample; human genome) for each of your samples in the study

2. Number of sample submitted are less than 20

3. Sample metadata (sample conditions and comparisons to be done) shared with CCBB prior to sequencing

4. 3 or more biological replicates per condition in your experiment

5. Reference genomes considered as standard: human, mouse, rat
