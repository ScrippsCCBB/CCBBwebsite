#### CCBB is empowering you with tools for self-directed data analysis

Please follow the instructions and get access to our analysis pipelines:

###### Step1 
As you will access our pipelines on Garibaldi, please get your account on Garibaldi by emailing [HPC](mailto:hpc@scripps.edu) (if you do not have one already).

###### Step2
Setting up Workflow, an interface to access CCBB pipelines on Garibaldi:\
Please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ScrippsCCBB/CCBBwebsite/blob/main/WorkFlow_User_Setup_Guide_May2025.pdf) to setup workflow on your computer.\
Please note that workflow needs to be set-up only once.

###### Step3

Email [CCBB](mailto:ccbb@scripps.edu) to find out if you have signed up already!

#### CCBB Pipelines on Garibaldi 
- Bulk RNAseq analysis [user guide](../CCBB_pipelines/bulk_RNAseq.md)
- Differential Abundance analysis [user guide](../CCBB_pipelines/differential_abundance.md) (prerequisite: run Bulk RNAseq analysis)
- 10x single cell gene expression (standard) analysis [user guide](../CCBB_pipelines/10xscGEX.md/)

###### Step4 
Consult [CCBB](mailto:ccbb@scripps.edu) for any downstream custom work including generating figures for publication, comprehensive functional analysis (with our licensed product Advaita’s iPathwayGuide), submitting data to public repositories etc. 

###### Step5
