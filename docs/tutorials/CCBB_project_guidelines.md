# 2022 - Sequencing Project Guidelines

Have a sequencing project? Follow the steps below for an effective and
efficient outcome for your requests:

**STEP 1:** Email Steve Head, Genomics Core Director, at
<a href="mailto:shead.at.scripps.edu">shead.at.scripps.edu</a> to
discuss your proposed project and include
<a href="mailto:ccbb.at.scripps.edu">ccbb.at.scripps.edu</a> if you are
interested in Raw data / fastqs / data analyses. This step is critical
to identify and allocate the right set of resources for good time/cost
estimates.

**Tip:** Share the biological context of your sequencing project (simple
text or “Fig.1”).

**STEP 2:** Submit a request for access to Genomics Core facility at
Idea Elan database, Infinity,
<a href="https://secure21.ideaelan.com/secure/public/applogin.aspx">secure21.ideaelan.com</a>
if this is your first sequencing project.

**STEP 3:** If you already have access to the Genomics Core facility,
please login and submit the Sample Submission form available under the
“Request Services” tab. Need help? Email Sheila Roberts Weiland at
<a href="mailto:shkay.at.scripps.edu">shkay.at.scripps.edu</a>.

**STEP 4:** Samples can be submitted to the Genomics Core facility
during office hours on weekdays. Coordinate with John
(<a href="mailto:jshimo.at.scripps.edu">jshimo.at.scripps.edu</a>),
Jessica
(<a href="mailto:jledesma.at.scripps.edu">jledesma.at.scripps.edu</a>),
or Nick (<a href="mailto:nvlee.at.scripps.edu">nvlee.at.scripps.edu</a>)
to leave your samples in the freezer near the front door of the
facility:

Building Name: Skaggs Institute For Chemical Biology, Campus Map
(<a href="https://www.scripps.edu/_files/pdfs/footer/contact/scripps-california-campus-map.pdf">Scripps
California Campus Map</a>) MB-28, 10596 N. Torrey Pines Rd., La Jolla CA
92037.

**STEP 5:** If you plan on receiving raw data on a hard drive, deposit
an external hard drive with enough space at the Genomics Core facility
at the time of sample submission.

**STEP 6:** (Non-Scripps) External customers requesting fastqs and/or
results of analysis (any processed data) must create an AWS S3 bucket
with specifications provided
<a href="https://github.com/ScrippsCCBB/CCBBwebsite/blob/main/DataDispatch_via_AWS_S3bucket.pdf">here</a>
and share the requested details with
<a href="mailto:ccbb.at.scripps.edu">ccbb.at.scripps.edu</a> at the time
of sample submission.

**STEP 7:** Consult our services page and click the relevant service
type to get a quick glance at the timelines/costs involved (in terms of
the number of hours for CCBB effort) for completing your requests.

**STEP 8:** Follow the “Recommended Guidelines for Authorship on
Manuscripts”.

**STEP 9:** Please give us your feedback to better serve your sequencing
needs!

\*\* STEPS 2 and 3 apply to internal (Scripps) customers only.
